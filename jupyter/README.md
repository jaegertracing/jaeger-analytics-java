# Spin up Jupyter Notebooks with Trace DSL

Jupyter notebooks provide a simple user interface for experimenting with data. There are two main use cases that we want to accomplish with the notebooks:

- an interface for data scientists to experiment with tracing data
- on-demand incident investigation

The second point is the reason why we have developed Trace DSL based on graph query language Gremlin to simplify filtering and feature extraction of tracing data. Because such analysis might not be feasible in the user interface where thousands of traces or set of traces with hundreds or thousands of spans are to be analysed. Hence a Jaeger user would be able to spin up a Jupyter notebook on demand with the Trace DSL and write a query and analysis.

## Jupyter notebook example with Jaeger

Now, let's see how we can deploy Jupyter notebook with Jaeger trace DSL and write a simple query against the Jaeger server.

For this, first we need to deploy Jaeger UI, HotROD - a demo application and Jupyter notebook with Trace DSL.

1. For Jaeger UI: 

``` bash
docker run --rm -it -p 16686:16686 --name=jaeger jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.20
```
This will open up the Jager UI at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686/)

2. For HotROD demo application, run
``` bash 
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 --link=jaeger -e JAEGER_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:14268/api/traces jaegertracing/example-hotrod:1.17
```
This will start the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

3. Lastly, for spinning up the notebook that are hosted in this [repository](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-analytics-java)


``` bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 4041:4040 -p 9001:9001 --link=jaeger -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes quay.io/jaegertracing/jaeger-analytics-java:latest
```

*Note : Add `-v ${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work` to Jupyter notebook if you want to open the notebooks from your current directory.*

After successfully running the docker commands, you will be able to see a URL in you terminal with unique token. Paste that URL in your browser to start the Jupyter notebook.

## Analysis

For the analysis we have to generate some data, so in the HotROD UI click on the blue boxes to order a car that generates nice traces. To verify that the trace reached Jaeger open Jaeger UI and search for traces from the `frontend` service. 
You'll be able to see the generated traces for the services and operation. 

Once we know that the data is stored in Jaeger we can move to Jupyter notebook and load the trace on the notebook. For that we will use `jaeger-query.ipynb` notebook for further steps. Notebooks are stored in the jupyter directory. 

This directory can either be opened from the project root directory or from work in case the notebooks from host filesystem are injected into the container.

Before running the analysis we have to load dependencies into the notebookâ€™s classpath. Just click on the dependencies cell to make it active and then on the play icon in the top navigation menu. 

Before running the code we have to update the variable `traceIdStr` to point into one of the traces we have generated earlier in the HotROD app. We need to do this under **Run Analysis** cell.
It should look something like:
```java
String queryHostPort = "jaeger:16686";
String traceIdStr = "2cb1f0c274c3b4a5"
```
The results are written below the code cell. In this case the trace has the height 3 and there is one calculated network latency between frontend and server service of 0.00102 ms . The latency is small because all services are run as part of the same process and there is no real network overhead.

The last code cell shows the direct use of Trace DSL with Apache Gremlin. Gremlin is a graph traversal language and class TraceTraversalSource.class it extends and adds methods for trace filtering and feature extraction. For instance, it adds a method like `hasName(String name)` to filter spans by operation name. In our example the query verifies whether two spans with given operation names are directly or indirectly connected, or in other words one is a descendant of the other.

This feature provides a powerful interface to write a custom query and hypothesis analysis against traces retrieved from the Jaeger server. The example can easily be extended to collect a stream of traces from Kafka and experiment on the live data.
